YamClient leaks connections when .connect() is called multiple times.
    Expected behaviour would be to have one Deferred per .connect()/.disconnect() cycle, optionally reset if the connection is lost for other reasons.
    Rationale:

        def buildClient():
            client.connect().addCallback(...)

            return client

        ...

        buildClient().connect().addCallback(...)

    The library is architected around having a single reference to client (thinking of memoize)
    Additionally, YamClient's constructor passes "connected=True" automatically, so any further connect() calls are entirely in error and leak connections immediately.
